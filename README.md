# A-mobile-application-for-medication-management
‘Taafi’ is a mobile application for medication management that supports Arabic language and runs on iOS and Android platforms. The application supports the main functions of drug management such as pill reminder and drug-drug interaction (DDI) checker. This project uses different machine-learning techniques for scene text detection, recognition, and DDI detection.
<br> to implement Taafi application we used dart language as front-end, dart is used within the Flutter framework to implemnt cross-platforms applications. Also, we used python to implemnt the DDI and then intigrated with the futter. For the data management, we used Firebase firestore and Authentication.
